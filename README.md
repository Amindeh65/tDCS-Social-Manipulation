# tDCS-Social-Manipulation

We independently manipulated left motor cortex tDCS (anodal vs. cathodal) and socially induced expectations about tDCS effects (analgesia vs. hyperalgesia) in a double-blind, randomized 2 x 2 factorial cross-over design (5 sessions per participant on separate days).

## Description of the Experiment

### Overview

In this double-blind, randomized cross-over study, we aimed to investigate the effects of 20 min 2mA anodal vs. cathodal tDCS of the left motor cortex (M1) and analgesic vs. hyperalgesic expectations of treatment effects on pain responses induced by thermal stimulus in a multi-session pain paradigm. Participants underwent five experimental sessions on separate days, including a pain calibration session followed by four test sessions. Test sessions involved pain before and after each of four treatments, which crossed tDCS stimulation type and socially induced expectancies in a 2 x 2 design:  Anodal or cathodal tDCS treatment (M1, 20 min) crossed with socially induced analgesic pain-reducing or hyperalgesic pain-enhancing expectations. The social manipulation consisted of videos of previous ‘participants’ describing tDCS as inducing a disembodied, low-pain state (‘analgesic expectancy’) or hypersensitivity to somatic sensation (‘hyperalgesic expectancy’). Treatment order in sessions 2-5 was randomized,  with 6-7 days interval to minimize carryover effects.

## Experiment Steps

### Step 1: Calibration Phase

    Participants completed an adaptive thermal calibration to determine individual pain and tolerance thresholds.
    Stimuli temperatures were personalized using logistic regression:
        Run 1: Fixed temperature of 47°C.
        Run 2: Randomized stimuli at 45°C, 47°C, and 48.9°C.
        Runs 3-4: Tailored low and high temperatures based on prior responses.

### Step 2: Experimental Sessions
#### Each session included:
    Pre-intervention pain testing: Thermal stimuli delivered to two calibrated forearm sites.
    Social manipulation: Videos describing analgesic or hyperalgesic tDCS effects.
    tDCS intervention:
        2mA stimulation for 20 minutes using the StarStim system.
        Anode: C3; Cathode: FP2.
    Post-intervention pain testing: Pain responses to thermal stimuli were recorded.

### Step 3: Questionnaires assessed:
    Expectations about tDCS effects.
    Sensations experienced during stimulation.
